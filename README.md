# Movies Project 

Project ‘Movies’ explores factors that influence movies ranking over time. Are we able to identify factors that high ranking movies have in common? To try to answer this question we analysed the data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) that collects information on films, including actors and production crew involved, the genre, year and rank. For this project, our analysis focused solely on directors only; we also used data on the genre, year and rank.
1.	Cleaning and transforming of the data and initial analysis were done in Python, the code is available in the file Movies_Mini_Project.ipynb
2.	The cleaned dataset is available as  final_clean_movies(2).csv
3.	Visualization of the data was done in PowerBI, to see the dashboard please go to Movies_project.pbix
